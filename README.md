## General Information Theory 4D Photon-Electron Gauge Group ForAll Wavelengths and Energy Levels
 
[3] **Theorem 1** MathematicaÂ® notebook [4DGEMEOSphoton-electronProof.nb](https://github.com/ehounder/npjGeneralInformationTheory/blob/main/4DGEMEOSphoton-electronProof.nb) posted in Raw InputForm. To run the code, copy and paste into Mathematica notebook, in the pop-up choose to "interpret the text and open it as a new notebook." Then in the new notebook convert the TraditionalForm to StandardForm which returns: 

ForAll wavelengths and energy levels: True => True && True => True.

An [AI Peer Review ChatGPT-Wolfram Mathematica Notebook Prompt](https://github.com/ehounder/AI-Report-AI-Peer-Review) is available in a separate repository - which is much too long for ChatGPT at this point - nevertheless shows some improvement in AI math aptitude, but not even close to AGI...not yet anyway.
