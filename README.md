## General Information Theory 4D Photon-Electron Soliton Gauge Group ForAll Wavelengths and Energy Levels

[3] **Theorem 1** MathematicaÂ® notebook [4DGEMEOSphoton-electronProof.nb](https://github.com/ehounder/npjGeneralInformationTheory/blob/main/4DGEMEOSphoton-electronProof.nb) posted in Raw InputForm. To run the code, copy and paste into Mathematica notebook, in the pop-up choose to "interpret the text and open it as a new notebook." Then in the new notebook convert the TraditionalForm to StandardForm which returns: 

ForAll wavelengths and energy levels: True => True && True => True.

[ChatGPT-Wolfram-AI-Peer-Review-Prompt](https://github.com/ehounder/npjGeneralInformationTheory/tree/main/ChatGPT-Wolfram-AI-Peer-Review-Prompt) folder contains the 4D GEM EOS Mathematica notebook code for a ChatGPT-Wolfram AI Peer Review of Standard Model of Physics vs 4D GEM EOS. ChatGPT-Wolfram responses show improvement in AI math aptitude, but not even close to AGI...not yet anyway.

The above ChatGPT-Wolfram-AI-Peer-Review-Prompt folder is a partial derivative of much longer ChaptGPT-Wolfram prompt (much too long at this point): [AI-Report-AI-Peer-Review](https://github.com/ehounder/AI-Report-AI-Peer-Review) entered in the [2023 Kaggle AI Report Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/2023-kaggle-ai-report/overview).
