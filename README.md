**QED 0D→4D photon and electron energy/mass densities, relative permittivities and impedances from Einstein-Maxwell tensor integrations**
 
[3] **Theorem 3.1** Mathematica® notebook [4DGEMEOSphoton-electronProof.nb](https://github.com/ehounder/SupplementaryMaterial/blob/main/4DGEMEOSphoton-electronProof.nb) posted in Raw InputForm. To run the code, copy and paste into Mathematica notebook, in the pop-up choose to "interpret the text and open it as a new notebook." Then in the new notebook convert the TraditionalForm to StandardForm which returns: True => True && True => True.
